The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists?

Patreon: https://bit.ly/4aiJZNF  Credits Writer:  Callum Griffiths Editor: Frame Forge Thumbnail Designer: Peter Sheppard Producer: Alex McColgan/ Raquel Taylor   Clarification: pH can only be measured in water-based solutions and superacids are explosive/not soluble in water, so it doesn’t make sense to place them on a PH scale and instead we should use the Hammett Acidity Function (H0). That being said, we can and do typically derive negative pH from this function using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation which makes H0 equivalent to the pH values. This should have been explained further in the video.  Correction: Zeti Reticuli only being visible from the Southern Hemisphere is part of the plot, suggesting those on the Northern Hemisphere must have received this information from aliens or advanced means.

Mariner 10 in 1974, MESSENGER in 2011 and BepiColombo due to arrive in 2025. Of these prior two missions, only MESSENGER went into orbit around Mercury, and so it is the only mission to ever give us close up shots of Mercury’s surface.

Whatever your thoughts on this, it marks a fascinating point in human history. In the past, the space race was exclusively a contest or collaboration of nations. But now, private companies are beginning to enter the fray. Why this sudden change? And what does this mean for the future of space travel and exploration, now that businesses are starting to look to the stars? What might it mean for humanity’s future?  Elon Musk has always made it clear that he intends to one day see a colony on Mars, and in 2001 his company conceptualised greenhouses that might grow plants there. Any such colony will no doubt need supplies from earth, particularly in its early days, as vital equipment and personnel would need to be transported over. Any company with the largescale capability to transport heavy weights between Earth and Mars would stand to make a lot of money. In 2001 Musk attempted to buy rockets that might start the process of getting supplies to Mars, but realised that it would be cheaper to create his own.  #spacex #blueorigin #virgingalactic #spacetourism","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/px1JfiGBy-Y/maxresdefault.jpg"

Image Credits: NASA  The Flying Exploration Polar Rover, or VIPER, is NASA's lunar rover that will explore water ice and other resources available on the Moon's surface. VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) is a lunar rover developed by NASA (Ames Research Center) that is currently due to be delivered to the lunar surface in November 2023.  The lunar region of the South Pole as a whole will be busy with missions to Noble Crater in 2023, as well as Shackleton Crater (near the IM-2 landing site). The moon is already well mapped thanks to past NASA missions such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Data from Luna 24, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Indian Chandrayaan 1 Orbiter, and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sounding Satellite showed that lunar water is widely (albeit slightly) distributed over the lunar surface, especially at constant shaded craters in the region of the South Pole. In 2009, NASA followed up the discovery with the Lunar Crater Observation and Sounding Satellite (LCROSS), which crashed into the Moon and further confirmed water ice. Data from NASA's SOFIA observatory helped find real molecular water on the moon's solar surfaces. In one study, researchers found water right on the lunar surface by finding the molecule in sunlit areas of the moon.  NASA's orbital missions have shown that there is water ice on the moon, especially in the deep, permanent shadows of some mountains and craters. For years, scientists believed that ice craters at the lunar poles contained water ice, both a scientific advantage and a potential resource for human missions. Observations from India's Chandrayaan-1 probe in 2008 and NASA's LCROSS mission in 2009 indicated that the moon's south pole region contains water ice, which was detected in emissions from the planned Centaurus constellation. The rocket crashed in a permanently shadowed crater at the moon's south pole. In support of the presentation, NASA has also been very vocal about mining water ice on the moon.  At the end of 2023, NASA plans to send a rover called Viper to the Moon, which will map the location of water ice on the lunar surface and collect samples. NASA's first mobile robotic mission to the Moon, VIPER, will carry a TRIDENT drill and scientific instruments that will directly analyze water ice on and below the surface of the Moon at different depths and under different temperature conditions. NASA believes the VIPER rover will help create the first global maps of the Moon's water resources. Even before the shipment happens, private company Intuitive Machines plans to send a robotic lander to the lunar surface in 2022, equipped with the same drill Viper will use.  On Monday, NASA announced that in 2023 a golf cart-sized VIPER will land near the western rim of Nobile Crater on the Moon's south pole, at the moon's south pole. The water-hunting Viper rover will travel alongside space robotics company Astrobotics Griffin, which will accompany the rover to the surface.

It left the protoplanet Vesta in 2012, reached the dwarf planet Ceres in 2015, and remained in orbit after a successful mission in 2018.  When Dawn entered orbit around the asteroid Vesta, it became the first spacecraft to circle an asteroid in the area where most of the Solar System's asteroids are found, in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter. Dawn is part of the NASA Discovery mission and was designed to orbit the asteroid Vesta, which is located between Jupiter and Mars. The Asteroid Belt Unmanned Probe is a mission designed to rendezvous with and orbit the asteroid Vesta, the largest asteroid. As with the asteroid Vesta, the unmanned asteroid belt probe entered a series of circumpolar circular orbits that will provide vantage points to study almost the entire surface of the dwarf planet.  Dawn was the first mission to explore the dwarf planet, reaching Ceres a few months before the New Horizons probe arrived at Pluto in July 2015. Dawn was also the first mission to visit a dwarf planet, several months ahead of New Horizons, which made a historic flyby of Pluto and Charon in July 2015.  Dawn is the first spacecraft to ever successfully fly around two extraterrestrial objects. Dawn will now permanently orbit Ceres, testifying to the pioneering spirit of space exploration.  Dawn was originally expected to leave Vesta on August 26, 2012 and begin its two-and-a-half-year journey to Ceres. Transit month. , arrived at Ceres on March 6, 2015. Dawn reached the large asteroid Vesta on July 16, 2011 and orbited Vesta until September 5, 2012, when it traveled to the dwarf planet Ceres.  After leaving the asteroid Vesta, Dawn traveled to the dwarf planet Ceres, becoming the first spacecraft to visit and orbit a dwarf planet and the first to orbit two alien targets. On her second flight, Don will travel to Ceres, where she will become the first spacecraft to visit a dwarf planet and orbit two alien objects. Engineers deorbited Dawn from the asteroid belt in 2012 and brought Dawn into the asteroid belt for more than two years before placing it in orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres, where it has been since 2015 Data collection.  In 2011, NASA's Dawn spacecraft took the 600-kilometer egg-shaped Vesta into orbit for a year before heading to Ceres, arriving in 2015. solar system.

Image Credits: NASA  #projectmercury #projectgemini #apollo #nasa #astrumspace #redstone   “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Just like with Isaac Newton, the Apollo program did not stand alone. Its achievements would not have been possible if it had not been for the important missions that ran before it and alongside it. It built on the understanding learned from those missions, expanded on their technology, and drew on the expertise of the people who worked on them. I’m Alex McColgan, and you’re watching Astrum. Join with me today as we examine two of those vital early programs – Project Mercury and Project Gemini – and investigate how they helped a fledgling NASA to gain a greater understanding of how to put a man on the moon. I hope by the end of this video to have earned your like and subscription. NASA as an institution has not been around forever. It was only created in 1958, in response to the Soviet Union launching the Sputnik satellite about a year earlier. However, it’s not accurate to say that NASA was completely new, even in 1958.  When US President Eisenhower signed off on the formation of NASA, he did it by combining several already existing programs and institutions. There was the NACA (the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), the US Army’s Ballistic Missile Agency, and German scientists who had worked on ballistic missiles for Germany during World War Two. Beyond that, the US Air Force had been working on a “Man in Space Soonest” (or MISS) program, which was also given to NASA, along with some of their facilities. These alongside other government projects provided the foundation for NASA. However, amongst all of these, there wasn’t a way to get a human into orbit. The closest was the X-15 program of the NACA. This aeroplane was able to skim the edges of space, and in the early 1960’s broke records by flying to a height of 105.9km, and achieving speeds of over 6000 km/h. A later X-15 broke 7,200 km/h and holds the record to this day for the fastest crewed, powered aircraft. However, while this was above the Karmin line of 100km, the FAI’s definition of space, this really is the limit of an airplane. Something more would need to be developed to get a human into orbit, and ultimately to the moon. And so, NASA began its first project to get a human properly into space – Project Mercury. Project Mercury’s mission was a continuation of the “Man in Space Soonest” program – and as that name suggests, its objective was to get a man into Earth orbit and back again safely, ideally before the Soviet Union. This would not be an easy task. Riding a rocket into space meant an astronaut would need to deal with G-forces, intense vibrations, the risk of explosion from riding on what was basically a repurposed missile, and the threat of catastrophic burning up on re-entry. Scientists also worried about radiation once an astronaut left the atmosphere, and even micrometeors striking the ship. While some of these threats proved to be negligible (the odds of being hit by a meteor turned out to be very small), the rest were very real dangers to a human life. The rockets NASA used for Project Mercury were the Redstone rocket, which was later replaced by the Atlas rocket. Both of these rockets were originally designed as missiles. The Redstone was a direct descendant of the German V-2 rocket developed for use in the war. When the Second World War ended, America brought German scientists over and put them to work developing American weapons and technology. Wernher von Braun, a German scientist brought over in this way, became a chief engineer at NASA, and was instrumental in helping develop the rocket technology for Project Mercury and later Apollo.","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXh-EeMY0IU/maxresdefault.jpg"

Image Credits:  NASA/ESA/HASSELL/EOC/SpaceX  Music Credits:  Andrew Odd - Leaving Huma Huma - Nevada City Chasms - Wandering Gaze Scott Buckley - Ashes of a Fallen Year  In September 2016, Musk indicated that the full construction of SpaceX residential buildings on Mars would likely be funded by public and private funds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk advocates for a much broader set of long-term Mars settlement goals — ones that use these lower transportation costs to go well beyond what SpaceX will build. ""Build a city on Mars to become a space civilization, a multi-planet species,” said SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.  In 2007, before SpaceX even sent its first rocket into orbit, Musk told Wired that 30 years from now, bases would be established on the moon and the red planet. A topic that Elon Musk often brings up is that an end-of-life event on Earth could mean the end of humanity, but if humanity can build its foundations on a new planet like the Red Planet, humanity can survive. SpaceX has an ambitious goal of landing the first humans on Mars by 2024, but in October 2020, Elon Musk named 2024 the goal of an unmanned mission.  In March 2019, Elon Musk tweeted that it could be possible to have a self-sustaining city on Mars by 2050 if SpaceX launches in 5 years and requires 10 orbital syncs. 22 years at least to build a city. If Musk's predictions are correct — he's known for offering overly ambitious timelines — SpaceX's first Martian mission will launch the same year that NASA astronauts return to the moon as part of the Artemis program. Since SpaceX has yet to conduct SpaceX's first orbital flight with the upcoming Starship, it is unlikely that it will send the first cargo ships in 2050. SpaceX will then send four spacecraft to the next closest approach, two manned spacecraft and two cargo spacecraft in 2024.  His first rocket will allow SpaceX to send people and cargo to the Red Planet. The mission will be launched to Mars on the SpaceX South Texas spacecraft. SpaceX is almost ready to start building a permanent human settlement on Mars with the SpaceX spacecraft. The next-generation Starship spacecraft is a massive stainless steel rocket that SpaceX has built and tested at the company's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, near Brownsville.  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk previously estimated that full development of the next-generation Starship would cost about $5 billion, although SpaceX has not disclosed how much SpaceX has spent so far on the program. SpaceX launched two prototype spacecraft test flights, named SN5 and SN6.  SpaceX is on track to launch its first uncrewed mission to Mars in just four years, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said at the International Mars Society conference. Since the SpaceX spacecraft is also reusable, Elon Musk plans to refuel in low-Earth orbit before returning to the surface of Mars to return to Earth. Its first rocket used liquid oxygen and methane as fuel instead of the rocket fuel used by the Falcon 9, meaning researchers could fly to the red planet, refuel with resources on Earth, and return to Earth.  #colonizingmars   #astrum   #nasamarscolony   #buildmarsbase   #marscolonization   #howwouldwecolonizemars   #spacexmars   #spacexmarscolony   #spacex   #nasa  www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw/    This video was created on https://www.vudini.ai","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t_n0yhhuJBs/maxresdefault.jpg"

This is a recap of what it has achieved during its 20 year mission.  This is a reupload as the original video was blocked by PBS for a clip they did not own. The offending clip in question is the video from the perspective of Huygens as it passed through Titan's atmosphere. Even though I provided PBS evidence that the video belonged to NASA, even getting written confirmation from NASA that the clip is public domain and owned by them and not PBS, the claim was still upheld. Rather than risking legal action and a strike on my channel by appealing the decision, I have decided to modify the clip and reupload as I feel like it's a shame that this video has been blocked. I also feel like it's a shame that YouTube gives the ""copyright holder"" so much power and does not get involved in disputes. I can understand why it happens the way it does, but it's the creator that gets punished at the end of the day even if they are not in the wrong.  Before any Patreons get worried, I will obviously not be charging for this video :)  On a side note, my final major project is nearing completion! Expect to see it on the channel by mid May!

Not that I will be abandoning the other formats, but making videos like these will mean I can make videos more regularly for the channel so there isn't such a gap between videos.

About the colours of the images, it is RGB colours and does somewhat resemble the colours on Mars (the other option was false colour IRB images). However, HiRise doesn't take photos with just visible light, but rather with IR, RED, and BG channels which are displayed in red, green, and blue colours.

Virtual solar system: http://www.solarsystemscope.com/  About Cassini and Saturn: On June 30, 2004, the Cassini spacecraft entered orbit around Saturn to begin the first in-depth, up-close study of the ringed planet and its domain. As expected, the Saturn System has provided an incredible wealth of opportunities for exploration and discovery. With its initial four-year tour of the Saturn system complete as well as an initial two-year extended mission called the Cassini Equinox Mission, the spacecraft is conducting a second extended mission called the Cassini Solstice Mission.  ""We're looking at a string of remarkable discoveries -- about Saturn's magnificent rings, its amazing moons, its dynamic magnetosphere and about Titan's surface and atmosphere,"" says Dr. Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist. ""Some of the mission highlights so far include discovering that Titan has Earth-like processes and that the small moon Enceladus has a hot-spot at its southern pole, jets on the surface that spew out ice crystals and evidence of liquid water beneath its surface.""  Cassini's observations of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, have given scientists a glimpse of what Earth might have been like before life evolved. They now believe Titan possesses many parallels to Earth, including lakes, rivers, channels, dunes, rain, snow, clouds, mountains and possibly volcanoes.  The spray of icy particles from the surface jets collectively forms a towering plume three times taller than the width of Enceladus. The moon’s diameter is about 500 kilometers (around 300 miles) It is now thought that the plume feeds particles into Saturn's most expansive ring, the E ring. Already in the extended mission, the spacecraft has come as close as 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the moon's surface.  The results from the Cassini spacecraft and the European Space Agency's Huygens probe, which plunged through Titan's dense, smoggy atmosphere to its surface, have generated hundreds of scientific articles and been the subject of special issues of the world’s most important scientific journals.  The first four years of the Cassini-Huygens saga brought a new dimension of understanding of the complex and diverse Saturn system. The first, two-year Cassini Equinox Mission brought continued excitement. During that extended mission the spacecraft made 60 additional orbits of Saturn, 26 flybys of Titan, seven of Enceladus, and one each of Dione, Rhea and Helene. Investigations of Saturn's rings, the planet itself and new places within Saturn's magnetosphere also took place.

The video is from the Electro-L weather satellite. It takes a picture of the earth every half an hour from its geostationary orbit. This gives a great advantage to being able to monitor these weather events! Typhoons Nari (Santi) and Wipha (Tino) can also be seen from this position during the same time frame.
